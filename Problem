Two people are playing Advanced XO. The game is played in an n*n table. Each person in turn fills one of the houses in the table.
First person with X and second person with O. Empty houses are shown with -.
The winner is determined when at least a of the same houses are placed consecutively in a row with a column or 
diagonal (similar to normal XO).

The table of one of the stages of the game has reached us and we want to predict the next stage of the game!

If the second player can win the game with one move, print O.
